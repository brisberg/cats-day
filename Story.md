# A Cat's Day

The goal of the game is to capture the carefree, mischevious, and lackadaisical nature of a House Cat's day. Allow the player to explore the house, interact with various items and environments. Play with toys, attack shoes, knock things over.

The whole house isn't available at the start, you must interact with things to explore the house.
- Knock over a cardboard box to make a bridge up to the kitchen counter.
- Jump to a shelf, knock everything off the shelf to progress
- Play with the window blinds until they open, so you can rest in the sun.
- Ect

I like the idea that interactables are eventually exhausted, to push the player forward. So maybe you can play with a cat toy a few times, but eventually it flys off under the fridge and you can't reach it anymore.

It would be nice to add a touch of mystery to the game. Similar to Gone Home, you slowly discover where the family went. But it isn't stressful as the cat barely notices.
